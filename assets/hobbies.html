        <p>Most of my time is spent at home relaxing with my partner, Christopher, and our two 6 year old dogs, Maggie and Lili. Together we live in the suburbs of Wilmington, DE.</p>

        <p>We adopted Maggie and Lili in 2018 as a bonded pair. They are split almost 50:50 between American Bulldog and Labrador Retriever and are about 65 pounds each! They are liter mates and we adopted them together as a bonded pair.</p>
     <h2>Outdoor Adventures</h2>
        <p>I spend as much time as possible outside; I love to hike, backpack, and rock climb; If I'm not doing something active, I'm most likely reading a book somewhere outside!</p>

    <h2>Interior Design</h2>
        <p>In 2017, I took a woodworking class at the local community college and was instantly hooked in all things interior decorating. I love spending my time on a new DIY and feel instansly soothed when a space comes alive and makes visual sense.</p>
